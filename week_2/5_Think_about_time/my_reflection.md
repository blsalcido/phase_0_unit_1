# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
*   I am one of those tortured souls that fits into the categories of procrastinator AND perfectionist. I tend
*   to put things off if they seem overwhelming or unfamiliar to me, yet, I am uncomfortable when I end up having
*   to submit sub-par work due to having run out of time to work on my projects. Since there have been many changes
*   in my life recently, it's been a challenge to stay on top of all the Phase 0 work and to keep calm throughout
*   the process. I anticipate this to be a constant challenge for me and something I'll have to work around as it 
*   seems to be my "default" mode.  
* How will you combat that? 
*   I can improve my work habits, with practice, I'm sure. I just think it's extremely important to be honest with 
*   myself as I monitor for these tendencies. For instance, whenever I am faced with decisions that involve balancing *   daily life with DBC requirements, I must recognize if it is, in fact, necessary for me to hold off on working on 
*   assignments until I have completed some other task or if, maybe, I am just trying to justify procrastinating. 
* What techniques will you try?
*   I'm going to try setting a timer to keep me on task for periods of 25 minutes then taking a break for 5 minutes. 
*   Usually, if I'm really stressed out over something, I don't like to take breaks because I'm afraid I'll get off
*   task again. But, if the breaks are short and sweet, and if I really try to clear my head and meditate or even go 
*   for a brisk walk, I'll likely be able to get back on task. I need to be better about taking breaks so I can avoid
*   burn-out. I also want to approach the weekly assignments in order. I've make the mistake of jumping around from 
*   assignment to assignment working on several a little at a time and it's really inefficient to handle work loads 
*   like that. I get an overall sense that I'm not focused and it's hard to remember where I left off on a given 
*   assignment, too. I want to do things in order. This will probably help me not procrastinate. I'll know I can't 
*   put the assignment off just so I can play around with something else for a while. 
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
*   To get started as early in the week as possible and to try to keep my weekends as free of actuall assignment work
*   as possible. I think having the option of rest and relaxation time on the weekends will really help me regroup 
*   for the following week. Also, that would be a great time to review challenges instead of frantically trying to 
*   turn everything in on time. That's the most important part of my plan for DBC. Get an early start on the week's 
*   challenges. The second most important part would be to attend office hours as much as possible. That really 
*   seems to help solidify things for me. I also want to spend as much time as I can talking to my pairs about the 
*   week's challenges. Even if we've both already worked on and completed a given challenge seperately , I think 
*   sometimes just talking about the paths we each took to arrive at a solution can be very helpful. I also really 
*   want to swap my current desk chair out for a stability ball or maybe even try moving my computer to a high 
*   counter top so I can stand while I work. All this sitting has my lower back aching like crazy lately.
