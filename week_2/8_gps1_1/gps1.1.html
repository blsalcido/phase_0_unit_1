        <h2>Why Pair Programming is Important</h2>
          <p>Most programs are written in teams. So, pair programming is a great way to get comfortable 
            with the task of voicing your ideas and opinions to your team. This process helps you contribute
            to the team as a programmer and also provides an opportunity to get feedback on your ideas from your 
            peers.

        <h2>The Driver Role</h2>
          <p>The driver is the "brick and mortar" expert of the programming process. They figure out how to 
          implement the instructions they are given using proper syntax and efficient coding practices. Usually, 
          the driver is the person manning the keyboard. It is important to note that the driver may agree to switch 
          roles with their partner.

        <h2>The Navigator Role</h2>
          <p>The navigators are the creative guides to the programming process. As the driver could be thought of 
          the brick and mortar expert, The navigator could be thought of as the architect or the "project mastermind".
          They instruct the driver on what needs to be done in order to achieve the desired outcome of the project.

        <h2>Bridgette's Reflection</h2>
          <p>The biggest take away for me was the importance of pseudocodeing for html/css. This is something
          I had actually never tried before this assignment. I was amazed to find that pseudocode is just as important for
          an html/css project as it is for, say, a ruby project. It really helped my partner and I clear up some 
          misunderstandings we initially had when trying to convey our thoughts on what our site should look like. Once
          we worked a little more on our pseudocode, the rest of the project came together seamlessly. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Working with Kir was awesome! She was really helpful and really quick to research and answer any questions
          I had about editing our project. I think if we had had more time, we could have spent all night adding to our
          site because each of us was having a lot of fun. I appreciated how thoughtful Kir was when it came to design 
          choices. She really helped make our site look beautiful. 
          </p>
          <p>
          I learned a lot from this challenge. First, I shouldn't be so quick to rush into actually building a site,
          neglecting pseudocode. It's easy to get ahead of myself sometimes because I feel like things will come to 
          me naturally but, I should remember to stay patient and thoughtful in the early stages of development especially 
          when I am working with a partner. I also learned a few new css tricks and got some much needed practice with 
          HTML5. All-in-all, I am very pleased with how this session went.

          <h2>Kir's Reflection</h2>
          <p>
              Pairing with Bridgette was a lot of fun. At the very beginning we had a lot of problems communicating but after working with each other for awhile we managed to get a collaborative flow going. We were able to easily and quickly alternate from the driver and navigator positions as well, and clearly communicate our ideas. Bridgette was also honest and creative, and had lots of great ideas I wouldn't have thought of. She also knew exactly what to ask before I could even think of the questions and I loved how on top of the game she was.
          </p><p>
              Normally on my own I find it easier to build the template for content of the web page I'm designing based off of predrawn designs then work my way up piece by piece, but from this peer pairing session I was able to learn how useful and important pseudocode is to designing webpages. It makes it much easier to communicate what we're thinking and what our ideas are to our partners. Now that we've got a flow going I can't wait to peer with her again and see what we can do!
