Responsive web design is an approach to web design aimed at enriching user-experience and userability by limiting the amount of resizing and scrolling that is required by users accross a variety of devices and subsequently varied screen sizes. I think it's very good practice. I love when sites scale to my needs automatically.

Smartphones and tablets have created a market for sites that adjust their proportions to fit various user devices. I'll have to spend some time thinking about the second half of this question. I do think there's a trend towards simplicity. I think the more complex and advance devices become, the simpler and more comprehensive web designs must be in order for users to perceive their devices as "friendly".

Yeah, I think designing for blind people is definitely productive. Blind folks use senses like smell, touch, and hearing more than normal folks because their minds have adjusted for their lack of ability to see. I think designing for them would be very challenging and it's hard to say exactly how this could be done. I do know that I read an article about a smart phone device that functions alongside an app for producing smells while sending texts. Who knows, good question.

Nothing really seems stupid to me about web design. I think color theory is really important and I want to spend some time reading more about that. I did find it difficult to make my site look pretty using colors alone.
