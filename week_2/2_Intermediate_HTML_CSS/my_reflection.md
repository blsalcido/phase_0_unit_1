# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Well, I don't know if there is any advantage to the lack of uniformity among web browsers. It's diffucult to say what the unintended consequences of web standards might be but, from what I can gather based on what I know - that these standards are meant to establish uniformity among all browsers so that all designs for websites are compatible with said browsers - they seem like a good thing overall on the surface. As I said, I don't know if there would be unintended consequences in the event that these standards are not met by the companies that release new browsers - maybe there's a reason they don't want to conform. Maybe expecting them to would somehow limit their ability to produce new products? The idea of web standards sounds good to me but, I may be a little too new to the subject to judge appropriately.
It makes sense to me given my experience with reset.css, yes. Basically, everything is set to 0 on any browser so that, as a designer, you can design your site on the web equivalent of a blank canvas.
I do like the new HTML5 elements - I think they contribute to readability overall. I like being able to get specific with my naming even if it seems verbose.
Reset is necessary for design compatibility among browsers.
Yes. I've used Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. I noticed changes in the height of my text box on the solo challange. It's frustrating that my design looked different than I intended it to from browser to browser, absolutely.
