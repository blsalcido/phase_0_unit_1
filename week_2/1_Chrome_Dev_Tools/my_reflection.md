As I understand it, DOM is a convention for connecting web pages to programming languages. This is kinda going over my head, to be honest. I guess I just don't really understand how and why this is important. I get that it links sites to scripts but, beyond that, I don't know if I really understand why it's so special. 

Chrome tools is really cool. It's nice to be able to see what's going on under the hood of someone's website, so to speak. My site looks very simple. I think it's a good thing that the html looks so readable but, then again, I don't have half the content of the page I looked at. I don't know what happened to my css! It's so short and there's very little about it listed. It barely looks anything at all like what I wrote. The site I looked at on wordpress had very complicated looking code. There were all kinds of links embeded and, frankly, a lot of it went over my head. Humbling. To say the least.I want to become more comfortable with Chrome tools as I think they are extremely helpful.
